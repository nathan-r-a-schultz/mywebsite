            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Computing is something I am passionate about. I started my computer science journey by teaching myself to program in elementary school using the visual block-based programming language Scratch. 
                To build on my passion, I took extra-curricular programming classes at RP4K (Real Programming For Kids), where I learned object oriented programming and gained hands-on experience with languages like Visual Basic, C, C++, and C#. 
                Since then I have taken academic courses in Java, Javascript and Python. Additionally, I joined the computer science club at my high school.
                After high school I decided to attend Western University as I felt (and still feel) that it is an excellent school to pursue computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                Outside of school, computers are my hobby, as well as theatre, running, and working out. 
                In my spare time, I gained experience with HTML and CSS by creating website environments and have experimented with programming for unorthodox pieces of hardware. 
                Using C++, I programmed a pong game for the Nintendo DS. The game has a menu system, pause functionality, and a score system. 
                The game is able to run on official DS hardware through the use of a modified flash cartridge. 
                As for computer hardware, I have built PCs and have used the Raspberry Pi mini-computer to emulate other computing environments and operating systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Currently, I am in my second-year of Western University. I finished first-year with a 3.7 GPA and intend to do even better this year.
